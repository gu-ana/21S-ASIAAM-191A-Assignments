I used ASIAN_POP and TOTAL_POP. I used those fields to get the percentage of asians living in each county.
A problem that the dataset could have is I could totally flub the numbers and you wouldn't have known unless you
go row by row and check my answers(wh0 knows, maybe the information albert gave us was falsified). In terms of graph
making, if I had made the difference between the graduated values different and accidentally left out the legend/key, 
then there is nothing to go off of to compare except our brain thinking a color is closer to another.
