            Hi, My name is Ana and I am a 3rd CS major with a minor in Statistics. I wanted to take this class to
            explore map making, learn more about importances of maps, and make myself learn how to build a website.
            I'm not super well versed in HTML/CSS/JS but I can most likely understand what's happening if you give me a 
            source page. I do know more backend stuff such as kubernetes, docker, and apache. My hobbies are sleeping, 
            watering my plants, and playing video games.
        </p>

        <p> My goals as a critical digital map maker: </p>
            <ul> Give a voice to people and their experiences, not just as data.</ul>
            <ul> Become more well versed in map making for future projects I may be interested in.</ul>
            <ul> Force myself to learn Javascript.</ul>
